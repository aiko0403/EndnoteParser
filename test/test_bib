abstract={Raytracing dynamic scenes at interactive rates have received a lot of attention recently. We present a few strategies for high performance raytracing on a commodity GPU. The construction of grids needs sorting, which is fast on today's GPUs. The grid is thus the acceleration structure of choice for dynamic scenes as per-frame rebuilding is required. We advocate the use of appropriate data structures for each stage of raytracing, resulting in multiple structure building per frame. A perspective grid built for the camera achieves perfect coherence for primary rays. A perspective grid built with respect to each light source provides the best performance for shadow rays. Spherical grids handle lights positioned inside the model space and handle spotlights. Uniform grids are best for reflection and refraction rays with little coherence. We propose an Enforced Coherence method to bring coherence to them by rearranging the ray to voxel mapping using sorting. This gives the best performance on GPUs with only user-managed caches. We also propose a simple, Independent Voxel Walk method, which performs best by taking advantage of the L1 and L2 caches on recent GPUs. We achieve over 10 fps of total rendering on the Conference model with one light source and one reflection bounce, while rebuilding the data structure for each stage. Ideas presented here are likely to give high performance on the future GPUs as well as other manycore architectures.},

abstract={With the computing industry trending toward multi- and many-core processors, we study how a standard visualization algorithm, raycasting volume rendering, can benefit from a hybrid parallelism approach. Hybrid parallelism provides the best of both worlds: using distributed-memory parallelism across a large numbers of nodes increases available FLOPs and memory, while exploiting shared-memory parallelism among the cores within each node ensures that each node performs its portion of the larger calculation as efficiently as possible. We demonstrate results from weak and strong scaling studies, at levels of concurrency ranging up to 216,000, and with data sets as large as 12.2 trillion cells. The greatest benefit from hybrid parallelism lies in the communication portion of the algorithm, the dominant cost at higher levels of concurrency. We show that reducing the number of participants with a hybrid approach significantly improves performance.},

title={Drawing-Based Procedural Modeling of Chinese Architectures},

abstract={This paper presents a novel modeling framework to build 3D models of Chinese architectures from elevation drawing. Our algorithm integrates the capability of automatic drawing recognition with powerful procedural modeling to extract production rules from elevation drawing. First, different from the previous symbol-based floor plan recognition, based on the novel concept of repetitive pattern trees, small horizontal repetitive regions of the elevation drawing are clustered in a bottom-up manner to form architectural components with maximum repetition, which collectively serve as building blocks for 3D model generation. Second, to discover the global architectural structure and its components' interdependencies, the components are structured into a shape tree in a top-down subdivision manner and recognized hierarchically at each level of the shape tree based on Markov Random Fields (MRFs). Third, shape grammar rules can be derived to construct 3D semantic model and its possible variations with the help of a 3D component repository. The salient contribution lies in the novel integration of procedural modeling with elevation drawing, with a unique application to Chinese architectures.},
